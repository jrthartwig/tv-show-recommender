# TV Show Recommender

This Flask app recommends TV shows based on the similarity of their plot summaries to the plot summaries of shows the user likes. The similarity is calculated using the cosine similarity algorithm.

# Machine Learning Model

The app was built using a machine learning model that was trained on a dataset of TV shows and their plot summaries. The model was created using the scikit-learn library in Python.

# Collaboration with GPT3.5

The app was developed in collaboration with GPT3.5, a large language model trained by OpenAI. GPT4 and GPT3.5 were used to generate some of the plot summaries in the dataset used to train the machine learning model.

# Usage

To use the app, enter the name of a TV show you like and click the "Get Recommendations" button. The app will return a list of recommended shows based on the similarity of their plot summaries to the plot summary of the show you entered.
